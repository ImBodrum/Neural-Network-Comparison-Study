# Neural-Network-Comparison-Study

This repository contains the code developed for the FML Assignment 2024. The project applies various machine learning techniques to solve a classification problem using models such as Single-Layer Perceptron, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines. Key steps include preprocessing, feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.

## 📁 File Structure

- `Real FMLCode2024.ipynb` – Main notebook containing all preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation steps.
- `data/` – Directory to store input data files.
- `results/` – Output files such as model predictions or performance plots (create this if necessary).

## 🧠 Key Features

- Handles missing values and performs feature scaling
- Trains and evaluates multiple classifiers
- Applies hyperparameter tuning
- Visualizes model performance

## 🛠 Requirements

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
